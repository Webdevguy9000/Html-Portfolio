<h1>Ryan's All Time Top Movies</h1>
    <h2>My absolute top 3 movies</h2>
    <hr />
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Gladiator</h3>
        <p>Easily the best drama, action and war movie ever created. This movie offers a lot of sadness, 
            hope, grit and anger. Russle Crowe is amazing as the lead actor being the lead general for
             the roman army before getting betrayed. </p></li>
        <li><h3>The Secret Life Of Pets</h3>
        <p>In this movie we encounter the undercover life of pets, the things they do to get their owners recognition, 
            the tricks for treats, the conversations with their neighborhood, secret parties and much much more! It does
            and amazing job bringin our furry friends to life in a comedic way! 
        </p></li>
        <li><h3>Pineapple Express</h3>
        <p>Hilarious, outragous, silly, stupid, fun. What more can you ask for? </p></li>
    </ul>
